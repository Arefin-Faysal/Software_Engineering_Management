# --- Usage ---
my_account = BankAccount("Alex", 500)

# 1. Accessing via methods works perfectly
print(my_account.get_balance()) # Output: $500

# 2. Trying to access the private variable directly will fail
# print(my_account.__balance) # This would raise an AttributeError

# 3. Modifying data safely through encapsulation
my_account.deposit(150)
print(my_account.get_balance()) # Output: $650
